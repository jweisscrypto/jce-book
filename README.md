# Java Cryptography Extensions (Morgan Kaufmann) Source Code Samples

When this book was written back in late 2003, I never would have imagined people would still be using the book as a reference over 20 years later.

As the Morgan-Kaufmann site seems to have lost the link to the original source code samples referenced in the book, I'm sharing them here.

AS-IS
NO WARRANTY - this is 20+ year old source code!

# Dependencies
The original .zip file include two libraries: bcprov-jdk14-119.jar and cryptix-jce-provider. Given how old these versions are, I'm *not* providing them here in binary form.
